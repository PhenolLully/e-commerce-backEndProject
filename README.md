Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
  My motivation was to show that I understand how to complete a backend part of a project
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  I built this project in order to understand how ORM really works for my own understanding
- What problem does it solve?
  The problem it solves is completing the backend aspect of this E-Commerce project
- What did you learn?
  I learned that connecting routes is not as difficult as I thought I just know that I still have a lot to improve on.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

First a github repository needs to be created make sure it has a README.md file, then clone the repository and paste it in your Week 4 folder. Then open the developer folder in the class repository and copy the material inside the folder into the repository folder. Then you can continue work on the assignment.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
  ![CategoryScreenshot](./Main/assets/images/categories.png)
  ![ProductScreenshot](./Main/assets/images/products.png)
  ![TagScreenshot](./Main/assets/images/tags.png)
